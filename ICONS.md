# Icon Files Needed

The extension requires icon files in the `icons/` directory:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor. Suggested design:
- Chess piece silhouette (king, queen, or knight)
- Chess board pattern
- Or a simple "LA" (Lichess Analyzer) monogram

For quick testing, you can:
1. Create simple colored squares as placeholders
2. Use an online icon generator
3. Download chess-related icons from icon libraries

The icons are used in:
- Chrome extension toolbar
- Extension management page
- Extension popup
